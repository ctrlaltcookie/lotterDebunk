# The national lottery

The national lottery is absurd, and i aim to demonstrate this with a number of small applications that put the lottery through it's paces.

When run with 

```javascript
playBulk(10, 7, 8000);
```
The result is: 

```
Lets play the lottery 10 time a week, with 7 lines, for 8000 years
You played the lottery 29120000 times in 8000 years and managed to win: 0 times, this cost you £58240000
```

If this isn't damning enough, here is another simulation:

```
Lets play the lottery 1000 time a week, with 7 lines, for 800 years
You played the lottery 291200000 times in 800 years and managed to win: 0 times, this cost you £582400000
```

I have run this simulation multiple times, it is possible to win, i have confirmed this, however, given the normal setup of the lottery, it is absurdly unlikely for someone to win, hence all the roll overs where there is no winner.
